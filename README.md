## DevOps

This is the learning path every new cloud engineer has to follow when joining the XPeppers Cloud team.
This path reflects our team's culture and values, which have their roots in the [agile values and principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/).

Please feel free to fork and contribute, add materials, fix the existing ones and propose new stuff.

During all the plan read [The Phoenix Project](https://books.google.it/books/about/The_Phoenix_Project.html?id=qaRODgAAQBAJ).
